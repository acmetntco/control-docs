# MineServ Server Control

## Description

MineServ Server Control is a web application that allows users to manage their virtual machines (VMs) on Azure. The app provides a user-friendly interface to start and stop VMs, view their status, and manage them efficiently.

## How It Works

1. **VM List**: The app displays a list of VMs with their names, locations, and power states.
2. **Start/Stop VMs**: Users can start or stop VMs by clicking the respective buttons in the control column.
3. **Automatic Updates**: The VM list is automatically updated every 60 seconds to reflect the current status of the VMs.
